      <h1>Start Your Library</h1>
      <p>
        This is a human-handled, done-for-you archive service.
        You choose your library type and design style — we carefully assemble and deliver your completed library as a client-owned archive.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you were referred by a partner, you’ll have a place to enter your referral code in the form.
      </p>

    <!-- What happens next (calm expectations) -->
    <section id="start-steps">
      <h2>What happens after you submit</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>We review your request</strong> to confirm scope and completeness.</li>
        <li><strong>We send the next steps</strong> (and payment instructions if applicable).</li>
        <li><strong>We assemble your library</strong> and deliver your completed archive.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Please avoid sending sensitive information you do not want included in your archive.

    <!-- Form Embed -->
    <section id="start-form">
      <h2>Submit your library request</h2>

      <!-- Replace this placeholder with your Google Form embed code -->
      <div id="form-embed" style="border:1px solid #ddd; padding:16px; border-radius:12px;">
        <p><strong>Form not connected yet.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Paste your Google Form embed code here when ready.
          For now, this page is prepared and working.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Optional fallback link -->
      <p style="margin-top:12px;">
        Prefer a direct form link? Add it here later as a backup.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reassurance -->
    <section id="start-note">
      <h2>Handled with care</h2>
      <p>
        TinyTeam libraries are personally reviewed and assembled.
        Design styles are applied exclusively to your project and delivered as a finished archive — not as reusable templates.
      </p>
      <p>
        After submission, you will be redirected only to the Thank You page once your form is complete (we’ll set that up next).
      </p>

    <!-- CTA -->
    <section id="start-cta">
      <p>
        <a href="thank-you.html">Go to Thank You page (temporary link)</a>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:0.95em;">
        (Later, the Thank You page will be the only redirect after successful submission.)
