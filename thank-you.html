    <h1>Thank you — we received your request</h1>
    <p>
      Your submission was received successfully.
      TinyTeam is a privacy-first, human-handled process, and every request is reviewed carefully.

    <p class="muted">
      Important: submitting the form does <strong>not</strong> create a project automatically.
      A Project ID is created only after manual review and validation.
