    <h1>Help & Guide</h1>
    <p>
      This guide helps you prepare your materials so TinyTeam can assemble your library smoothly and accurately.
      TinyTeam is a calm, human-handled, done-for-you process.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="help-prepare">
    <h2>What to prepare</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Library type:</strong> Family (FAM) or Community (COMM)</li>
      <li><strong>Design style:</strong> Heritage Classic, Modern Lineage, or Minimal Archive</li>
      <li><strong>People list:</strong> Names + optional notes (nickname, birth/death year, location)</li>
      <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Parent/child, spouse/partner, key connections</li>
      <li><strong>Photos & documents (optional):</strong> photos, certificates, letters, scanned pages</li>
      <li><strong>Stories (optional):</strong> short stories, timelines, key memories</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      Tip: If you’re unsure, submit what you have first. TinyTeam will follow up gently if anything needs clarification.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="help-relationships">
    <h2>How to describe relationships (simple examples)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Parent/Child:</strong> “Maria Santos is the mother of Jose Santos.”</li>
      <li><strong>Spouse/Partner:</strong> “Jose Santos is married to Ana Reyes.”</li>
      <li><strong>Siblings:</strong> “Jose Santos and Luisa Santos are siblings (same parents).”</li>
      <li><strong>Community:</strong> “Member A joined in 2002. Member B became a leader in 2010.”</li>
      <li><strong>Organization:</strong> “President → Vice President → Secretary → Members.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      You can submit in any format that is easy for you — text notes, lists, or a simple document.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="help-size">
    <h2>Library size & expansion</h2>
    <p>
      Each library is designed to comfortably support up to <strong>1,000 individuals</strong>.
      Larger families or extended branches can continue their archive by adding a connected library.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      If you think your archive will exceed 1,000 people, submit anyway — TinyTeam will recommend the best expansion approach.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="help-photos">
    <h2>Photos, documents, and stories</h2>
    <p>
      If you choose the Photo & Stories add-on, TinyTeam can carefully place photos and documents alongside the people and timelines they belong to.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear file names help (example: <em>“Grandpa-Jose-1968.jpg”</em>)</li>
      <li>Scans and photos are both accepted</li>
      <li>If you have a timeline, include it — even rough notes help</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      If you have a large collection, TinyTeam will guide you on the easiest way to submit it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="help-privacy">
    <h2>Privacy & handling</h2>
    <p>
      TinyTeam libraries are assembled through a careful, human-handled process.
      Please avoid submitting highly sensitive information you do not want included in the archive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your completed library is delivered as a <strong>client-owned archive</strong> you can store independently.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="help-delivery">
    <h2>What you will receive</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Finished deliverables:</strong> a completed archive output (digital book + structured records)</li>
      <li><strong>Client-owned files:</strong> designed for long-term keeping and portability</li>
      <li><strong>Simple guidance:</strong> what’s inside and how to keep it safe</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      Note: TinyTeam delivers finished outputs — not reusable templates or editable source files.
