      <h1>Help & Guide</h1>
      <p>
        This guide helps you prepare your materials so TinyTeam can assemble your library smoothly and accurately.
        TinyTeam is a human-handled, done-for-you process.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="help-prepare">
      <h2>What to prepare</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic details:</strong> Your library type (Family / Community / Organization) and your preferred design style.</li>
        <li><strong>People list:</strong> Names (and optional notes like nicknames, birth/death year, location).</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Parent/child links, spouses/partners, and key connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos & documents (optional):</strong> Family photos, certificates, letters, awards, IDs, or scanned pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Stories (optional):</strong> Short written stories, timelines, or historical notes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="help-relationships">
      <h2>How to describe relationships (simple examples)</h2>
      <p>Use any format that is easy for you. Here are examples:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Parent/Child:</strong> “Maria Santos is the mother of Jose Santos.”</li>
        <li><strong>Spouse/Partner:</strong> “Jose Santos is married to Ana Reyes.”</li>
        <li><strong>Siblings:</strong> “Jose Santos and Luisa Santos are siblings (same parents).”</li>
        <li><strong>Community/Group:</strong> “Member A joined the group in 2002. Member B became a leader in 2010.”</li>
        <li><strong>Organization:</strong> “President → Vice President → Secretary → Members.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you are unsure, submit what you have — TinyTeam will follow up with gentle clarifying questions when needed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="help-size">
      <h2>Library size & expansion</h2>
      <p>
        Each library is designed to comfortably support up to <strong>1,000 individuals</strong>.
        Larger families or extended branches can continue their archive by adding a connected library.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="help-photos">
      <h2>Photos, documents, and stories</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose the Photo & Document integration add-on, TinyTeam can carefully place photos and documents alongside the people and timelines they belong to.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear file names help (example: <em>“Grandpa-Jose-1968.jpg”</em>).</li>
        <li>Scans and photos are both accepted.</li>
        <li>If you have a timeline, include it — even rough notes help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have a large collection, TinyTeam will guide you on the easiest way to submit it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="help-privacy">
      <h2>Privacy & handling</h2>
      <p>
        TinyTeam libraries are assembled through a careful, human-handled process.
        Please avoid submitting highly sensitive information you do not want included in the archive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your completed library is delivered as a <strong>client-owned archive</strong> you can keep and store independently.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="help-delivery">
      <h2>What you will receive</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finished deliverables:</strong> A completed library output (example: a digital book PDF and/or a structured archive).</li>
        <li><strong>Client-owned archive:</strong> Files prepared for long-term keeping and portability.</li>
        <li><strong>Guidance:</strong> A simple README explaining what’s inside and how to keep it safe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size:0.95em;">
        Note: TinyTeam applies design styles per project and delivers finished outputs — not reusable template source files.
