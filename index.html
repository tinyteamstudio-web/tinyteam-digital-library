      <h1>A Living Digital Library, Carefully Built for Families, Communities, and Organizations</h1>

        We assemble private, long-lasting digital libraries that preserve people, relationships, stories, and documents —
        handled with care, one project at a time.

        Built to become an <strong>heirloom</strong> — something your family or community can return to for generations.

      <h3>Hi, I’m Chin Veloso</h3>
      <p>
        I design practical digital systems that help businesses and communities operate clearly,
        efficiently, and sustainably. I don’t automate blindly — I build systems meant to last.
      </p>

      <div class="about-brand">
        <img src="assets/logo/svp-funnels-logo.png" alt="SVP Funnels Logo" />
        <h4>SVP Funnels</h4>
        <p>
          I build streamlined funnels and automation for construction contractors,
          supporting businesses from pre-construction to post-project growth.
        </p>

        <h4>TinyTeam Studio</h4>
        <p>
          I build long-term digital systems for genealogy, organizations, communities,
          courses, and templates — designed to organize knowledge and preserve stories.

<section id="faq">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Clear answers — so you feel safe and confident before starting.
  </p>

  <div class="faq">

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is this public? Will my family information appear on Google?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        No. TinyTeam is privacy-first. Your library is not published as a public directory
        and is not indexed by search engines. Access is shared only with people you choose.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How will my family easily access the library?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        Your library is organized in a simple, clear structure that does not require
        special apps or technical skills. It is designed so even future generations
        can open, understand, and use it easily.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Will future generations still be able to access this?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        Yes. The system is designed for long-term use. Your children, grandchildren,
        and future relatives can still access and understand the library years from now.
        This is built as a lasting reference — not a temporary tool.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What if some family members have never met each other?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        That is very common. The library helps connect names, relationships, and branches
        even if people have never met personally. This helps clarify lineage and
        strengthen family identity over time.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can this help connect our clan with other family branches?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        Yes. When records are structured properly, it becomes easier to identify
        relationships between branches. Over time, families may discover shared
        lineage and reconnect through verified information.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What information do I need to start?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        You can start with what you already have — names, relationships, key dates,
        and any known stories. Missing details are okay. We guide you during validation
        and help complete the structure.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What if some information is missing or uncertain?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        That’s completely fine. You may submit partial information.
        During review, we validate what’s provided and request only what is needed
        to keep the library clean and accurate.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I update or add new relatives later?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        Yes. Libraries can be updated over time. Families grow, records improve,
        and new connections may be discovered. Updates are handled carefully
        to preserve accuracy and continuity.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Do you offer print-ready or physical copies?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        Yes. We can prepare print-ready formats so you can keep a physical copy,
        such as a family book or community archive, alongside the digital version.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How do payments work?</summary>
      <div class="faq-body">
        Payments are not auto-charged. Everything is manually verified.
        After submission, we confirm details and guide you through the next steps
        clearly and transparently.
