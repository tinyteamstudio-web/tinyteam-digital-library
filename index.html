      <h1>A Living Digital Library, Carefully Built for Families, Communities, and Organizations</h1>
      <p>
        We assemble private, long-lasting digital libraries that preserve people, relationships, stories, and documents —
        handled with care, one project at a time.

      <h2>What You Can Create with TinyTeam</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Family Library</h3>
        <p>Preserve generations of family members, relationships, stories, and photographs in a structured digital archive.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Community Library</h3>
        <p>Document clans, groups, or shared histories with people, timelines, and collective records.</p>

    <!-- 3) Design styles -->
    <section id="styles">
      <h2>Choose a Design Style for Your Library</h2>
      <p>
        Design styles define the visual presentation of your library.
        Each project is individually assembled using one selected style and delivered as a finished archive — not as a reusable template.
      </p>

      <article>
        <h3>Heritage Classic</h3>
        <p>Traditional layouts inspired by archival books.</p>
        <p><a href="start.html">Use This Style</a></p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Modern Lineage</h3>
        <p>Clean, contemporary presentation for growing families.</p>
        <p><a href="start.html">Use This Style</a></p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Minimal Archive</h3>
        <p>Quiet, structured design focused on clarity.</p>

    <!-- 4) How it works -->
    <section id="how">
      <h2>How the Process Works</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose Your Library & Style</strong><br />
          Select the type of library you need and the design style you prefer. This design will be applied exclusively to your project.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Submit Your Materials</strong><br />
          You’ll be guided to submit names, relationships, photos, and documents. Our team carefully organizes and reviews everything.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We Assemble & Deliver</strong><br />
          Your completed digital library is assembled, reviewed, and delivered as a private archive you can keep, share, and preserve.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- 5) Size & expansion -->
    <section id="growth">
      <h2>Designed to Grow with You</h2>
      <p>
        Each library is designed to comfortably support up to 1,000 individuals.
        Larger families, extended branches, or additional generations can continue their archive by adding a connected library.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6) Photos & documents -->
    <section id="media">
      <h2>Add Photos, Documents & Stories</h2>
      <p>
        We can carefully integrate photographs, letters, certificates, and written stories into your library —
        placing them alongside the people and timelines they belong to.
      </p>
      <p>Additional collections can be added as your archive grows.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7) Ownership & access -->
    <section id="ownership">
      <h2>Built for Long-Term Preservation</h2>
      <p>
        Every library is delivered as a complete, client-owned archive.
        You receive your files in formats designed for long-term keeping, with the freedom to store, share, and preserve them independently.
      </p>
      <p>Optional hosted access may be provided while the service remains active.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 8) Reseller (quiet) -->
    <section id="reseller">
      <h2>Introducing TinyTeam to Others</h2>
      <p>
        TinyTeam works with selected partners who help families and communities discover digital preservation.
        All libraries are still personally assembled and delivered by TinyTeam.
